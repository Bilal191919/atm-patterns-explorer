# üí≥ ATM Transactions Analysis üìä

This project analyzes real-world ATM transaction data using Python. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights from customer transactions through data exploration and visualization.

---

## üìÇ Project Overview

In this notebook-based project, we:

- Load transaction data from a CSV file
- Explore and clean the dataset using `pandas`
- Visualize transaction patterns using `matplotlib`
- Summarize insights that could help banks optimize ATM placement and services

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python üêç
- Pandas üìä
- Matplotlib üìà
- Jupyter Notebook üìì
